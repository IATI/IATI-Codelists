                The values from this codelist are used to identify the particular list that an organisation identifier was drawn from. The codelist provides a register of known identifier lists, including national company registers, NGO directories and international and multilateral organisation lists - along with guidance and online resources to help locate the identifiers assigned to a specific organisation.

                As of 17 July 2017 this list is maintained by the org-id.guide project. Data publishers can now search for and locate the relevant list for a particular organisation identifier using the `org-id.guide website <http://org-id.guide/>`__. The full register of identifier sources is also available to download in `XML <http://org-id.guide/download.xml>`__, `JSON <http://org-id.guide/download.json>`__ and `CSV <http://org-id.guide/download.csv>`__ formats.

                IATI periodically replicates the codelist of identifier sources from org-id.guide, to assist those accessing IATI documentation. However, it is advised that the most up-to-date source is the `org-id.guide project <http://org-id.guide/>`__.

                If org-id.guide does not contain an entry for the kind of organisation you need to identify, you can make a request a new list is included in the register following the `guidance <http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/contribute/>`__ or by getting in touch with org-id.guide at: contact@org-id.guide.
